        <h1>TAS stadium is very proud to be a starting point for many popular artists. Some of which became the most famous artists in the industry such as Taylor Swift, Adele and Harry Styles. Forever will we hold onto the memories from when they were performing to a small crowd to an entirely booked out stadium.</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="Adele">
        <h1>TAS has had the honour of hosting 6 different Adele Tours with many nights performed per tour. We watched Adele grow from a woman who loved to sing to the international icon she is today. Adele's voice and personality is truly unmatched, she is such a fun, bubbly and talented person.</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="queen">
        <h1>We have had the privilege of knowing Queen with both lead singers; Freddie Mercury and Adam Lambert. Watching Queen perform with 2 different singers has been a journey we are so grateful to have witnessed. TAS is so thankful to the band Queen to have played in our stadium even when we could only hold a very limited amount of people. RIP Freddie Mercury.</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="billie">
        <h1>Billie is one of our youngest performers to have sung in this stadium. When she approached us for an offer to sing we knew we had to reply immediately and give her a chance. One of the best decisions our team has made was getting Eilish in to perform for our biggest supporters. Forever thankful for Billie mentioning us when she won her first ever Grammy.</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="harry">
        <h1>TAS has watched Harry grow from before he was in One Direction! We have always loved hosting Styles for his tours. Watching him grow from a young teen to the young adult he is today has filled our hearts with so much joy for him.</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="OneD">
        <h1>We have had the honour of hosting One Direction for 4 different tours before the band broke up. Now that all the band members have moved on to have solo careers it makes these One Direction tour memories so much more special to us. These boys being so talented and dedicated so young is truly inspiring.</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="Tswizzle">
        <h1>Ofcourse we had to add Taylor Swift into our list of iconic concerts! Partnering with Swift while she was writing her "RED" album was the best move TAS could've made as we have had the opportunity to grow exponentially. "Make the friendship bracelets"</h1>
