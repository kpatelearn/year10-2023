    <div id="about">
    <p>TAS Stadium was first founded on the 21st of October 1989. The stadium originally held up to 5000 people, going by the name of One Stadium as it was the No. 1 choice in its earlier days. This stadium was the turning point for various artists while they were small; soon to blow up, such as Billie Eilish, Adele, Harry Styles and many more. Our greatest achievement was forming a partnership with Taylor Swift as her Red album was being written. Thanks to Swift we have had many opportunities to expand and grow our stadium and TAS can now hold 100,000 people at once.</p>
