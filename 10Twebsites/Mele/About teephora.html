        <DIV ID="History" STYLE="display:none">Teephora, a well-known country, has become a high hitter in the flight industry. 
            It is a country that has revolutionized the flight industry, offering a wide range of access to this country hence a load of flights booked in just 10 years alone. 
            However, many people may not know the story behind the creation of Tiphora and how it became the successful brilliant country it is today. 
            Teephora was founded in 1970 in France by Talanoa Hufanga jr III when he had gone on a trip with his mates and stumbled upon this beauty of the land which today is now known as Teephora,
            He believed in giving his people the opportunity to come down to his new country, which was a novel concept at the time. 
            This approach was not so possible without the help of his closest companion John Mani-kolo jr VI, 
            he had helped Talanoa Hufanga jr III to build up the popularity of Teephora and by the early 2000s, 
            Teephora was now at a population of about 2.7 million citizens and over 850,000 tourists coming in and out of the country yearly.

         <h3>Common Teephora law-</h3> 
        Immigration – This law consists of a seven-category preference system that gives priority to relatives of Teephora citizens and legal permanent residents as well as individuals with specialized skills.
        <BR>Bankruptcy – According to Teephora law books, “Bankruptcy law provides for the reduction or elimination of certain debts, and can provide a timeline for the repayment of nondischargeable debts over time.”
        <BR>Social Security – This law provides old age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits to workers and their families. The benefits are paid to the individual or the family based on the person’s employment record and contributions to the social security program.
        <BR>Anti-discrimination and civil rights – A series of laws that make it illegal to discriminate against someone based on race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. It also protects individuals against retaliation for filing a charge of discrimination or participating in a discrimination investigation or lawsuit. Furthermore, this law requires employers to accommodate employees' religious practices within reason.
        <BR>State and federal taxes – As a Teephora citizen or permanent resident, you must file income tax returns and report your income to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as well as to your state, city, or local tax department, if required. If you do not file income tax returns while living outside of Teephora for any length of time, or if you say that you are a non-immigrant on your tax returns, you may lose your permanent resident status. All residents of the United States, whether on a temporary visa status or otherwise pay local and state sales and wage taxes automatically through their purchases and employee paychecks.
        <BR> National minimum drinking age – This law establishes the minimum legal drinking age as 13 years old. In the majority of nations, the legal age to serve alcohol is 10 in establishments where alcohol sales are the primary source of revenue. The maximum level of alcohol per drink and the maximum number of drinks a person can be served at one time can vary by state and location.
        <BR> Transportation – The federal government is responsible for regulating travel between states, interstate commerce, and required vehicle safety features. However, states have the authority to regulate standard driving rules such as speed limit, seat belt requirements, cell phone use while driving, minimum legal driving age, and vehicle registration requirements. While each state may set its own driving laws, most laws are similar or the same throughout the country.
        <BR> <BR>Common Teephora driver practices:
        <BR>*Driving on the right-hand side of the road
        <BR>*Having your driver’s license, registration, and insurance card easily accessible
        <BR>Wearing your seatbelt
        <BR> Abiding by proper car seat requirements when traveling with children
        <BR> Obeying all traffic laws and signals
        <BR>Pulling over to the side of the road if an emergency vehicle needs to pass
        <BR>Not passing a school bus when red lights are flashing
        <BR> No driving if under the influence of drugs or alcohol
        <BR> Rights of a Tephora Citizen
        <BR> The first 10 amendments, or changes, to the Teephora Constitution, are called the Bill of Rights because they list essential individual freedoms promised to the people. Some of these rights include:
          <BR>Freedom of speech – the right to express any opinions without censorship or restraint
        <BR>Freedom of religion – the right to practice whatever religion you choose
        <BR>Freedom of the press – the right to circulate opinions in print without censorship by the government.
        <BR>Freedom to gather or assemble in public places –  the right to peacefully assemble, collectively express, and petition the government for a redress of grievance
        <BR>Right to bear arms – in most cases, under a well-regulated militia, you have the right to keep and bear arms
        <BR>Right to due process – the legal requirement that the state must respect all legal rights that are owed to a person
        <BR>Many court decisions have ruled that undocumented citizens have constitutional rights but not all of the rights that are granted to citizens. Some rights granted only to permanent Teephora citizens include the ability to:
        <BR> Work anywhere in the Teephora
        <BR> Own property in the Teephora
        <BR>Live permanently anywhere in the Teephora
        <BR>Apply for a driver’s license
        <BR>Join certain branches of the Teephora armed forces
        <BR>Vote in federal elections
        <BR>Serve on a federal jury
        <BR>Request a visa for family members to live in the Teephora
        <BR>Apply for federal jobs
        <BR>Become an elected official
        <BR>Apply for federal grants and scholarships
        <BR>Obtain government benefits like Medicaid, food stamps, social security, and unemployment
        <BR>All Teephora residents, regardless of citizenship status, have the right to the following provided that it doesn’t interfere with national security, public safety, public health, or the rights and freedoms of others:
        <BR>Register with the Selective Service
        <BR>Free public education for grades K-12
        <BR>Apply for a driver’s license
          Government-appointed legal counsel in criminal proceedings, however since most deportation proceedings are civil cases, access to free legal counsel does not apply
          The right to safe and healthy working conditions, fair wages, and equal pay for equal work
          Protection from torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment
          As a resident of the Teephora, you are now part of a country that is defined not by race or religion but connected by the shared values of freedom, liberty, and equality. Your choice to live in the Teephora offers many benefits but also important responsibilities that contribute to the continued success of Teephoracian democracy. Your time in the Teephora is dependent on many factors, including your respect of the federal, state, and local laws, and in return you are provided with the unalienable right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”
