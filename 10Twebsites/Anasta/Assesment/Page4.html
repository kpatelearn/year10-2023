    <h1>Culture and Traditions</h1> <br>
    <p>The people of <a href="Page1.html">Navarei</a> have many old <a href="Page4.html">traditions</a> that are still practiced to today. One of their main <a href="Page4.html">traditions</a> is that a baby's family isn't allowed to cut the baby's hair until she/he had their first step. As well as <a href="Page4.html">traditions</a>, <a href="Page1.html">Navarei</a> has many festivals celebrated throughout the year. Their biggest festival is called Larna which celebrates and commemorates the day that the <a href="Page2.html">Ovejarasa Peaks</a> were born. Legend goes that the old creater gods of myth wanted a king to watch over the land so they created Lefenki. After a few thousand years, Lefenki became lonely and asked the gods to make other mountains for company. The gods refused so Lefenki got so angry that he blew up and created 2 other mountains on either side of him by spilling some of his inner essence (lava). When Lefenki realized what he had done, he cried many tears of fear of what the gods will do to him, and those tears became what we know now as <a href="Page3.html">Lake Seoro</a> hasn't recieved his punishment and the people of Navarei say that the old gods are still deciding on a punishment. <a href="Page1.html">Navarei</a> remembers this day by rubbing ash on their faces and buying gifts for their friends to show their gratefulness to them. One of the main foods eaten at that festival is a spicy chilli soup called Eckir. It is one of <a href="Page1.html">Navarei</a>'s famed dishes and is only made at that particular time of year. There are also games and sports competitions held at that festival for families and kids of all ages. </p>
